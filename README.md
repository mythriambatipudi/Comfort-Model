# Quantifying Face Mask Comfort

This repository contains code and data associated with a manuscript describing a method of quantifying the comfort of a face mask.

This code enables the creation, training, and testing of three machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Neural Network) for quantifying face mask comfort when given three comfort parameters (air resistance, water vapor permeability, and face temperature change). 

Code for running the random forest and linear regression models can be found [here](https://github.com/mythriambatipudi/Comfort-Model/blob/main/RF%20and%20LM%20final%20version.R). Code for running the neural network can be found [here](https://github.com/mythriambatipudi/Comfort-Model/blob/main/NN%20final%20version.R).

To run these models, the respective R files must be downloaded, along with the datasheet located [here](https://github.com/mythriambatipudi/Comfort-Model/blob/main/ML%20final%20datasheet.xlsx).
